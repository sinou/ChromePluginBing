This is a chrome plugin that will get you your daily bing rewards points in one click!

The way it works now, you download the repo and store it in a convenient location -> open Chrome -> open Settings
-> select Extensions tab -> check Developer mode -> click on Load unpacked extension -> select directory "evilScript" -> click OK.
You will see a new emoticon right next to the hamburger button on the top right corner. This means the extension has been installed.
